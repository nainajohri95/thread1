runnable interface:- 
It provide facality to create thread without extending the Thread class.
It is presented in java.lang package.
It has only one method i.e public void run().
Since it has no any other method we have to create obj. of the Thread class that implements Runnable() target obj.


class ABC
{
  void func();
  {
    System.out.println("fun is working ");
  }
}
class rndemo extends ABC implements Runnable
{
  public void run()
  {
    for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
    {
      System.out.println(i);
      try
      {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
      }
      catch(Exception e)
      {
        System.out.println(e);
      }
    }
  }
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    rndemo obj = new rndemo();
    Thread th = new Thread(obj);
    th.start();
  }
}
